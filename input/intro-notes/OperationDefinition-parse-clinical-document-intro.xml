	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>This operation is used to parse and store a received FHIR Clinical Document.</p>
	<p> 
	As described in Special Topic <a href="immutableParseable.html">Immutable and parseable clinical documents</a>, FHIR Clinical Documents are used in a number of different ways, where users may need to store a received document as an immutable object and/or parse a received document to extract observations and other entries. Parsing a received clinical document can entail not only processing all of the resources that it contains as individual resources, but may also entail assessing each object's revision status such that a server correctly supersedes previously obtained objects with newly received amended objects. </p>
	<p>This IG further expands on the <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/documents.html#bundle">Document End-Points discussion</a> in FHIR Documents by providing a FHIR Operation that encapsulates the complexity of parsing a received clinical document.	</p>
