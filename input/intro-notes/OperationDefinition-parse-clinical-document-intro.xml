	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>This operation is used to parse and store a received FHIR Clinical Document.</p>
	<p>This IG further expands on the <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/documents.html#bundle">Document End-Points discussion</a> in FHIR Documents by providing a FHIR Operation that encapsulates the complexity of parsing a received clinical document.</p>
	<p>As described in Special Topic <a href="immutableParseable.html">Immutable and parseable clinical documents</a>, FHIR Clinical Documents are used in a number of different ways, where users may need to store a received document as an immutable object and/or parse a received document to extract observations and other entries. Parsing a received clinical document can entail not only processing all of the resources that it contains as individual resources, but may also entail identifying those objects that have already been received so as to avoid creation of duplicates, and assessing each object's revision status such that a server correctly supersedes previously obtained objects with newly received amended objects. </p>
	<p>Automated reconciliation of revised objects can be implemented in a number of ways. For instance, one can perform a <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#cond-update">conditional update</a> on a previously stored object, where the update is applied to the stored object that has the same identifier and date as the newly received amended object. Alternatively, one can simply store all objects, deferring to another system such as a document management system to collect objects and determine which are active. Yet another approach is to both store all new objects and update the status of previously stored objects to indicate that they have been superceded.</p>
	<blockquote class="stu-note">Automated reconciliation is an experimental workflow. We are seeking reviewer input on the need for a 'parse-and-reconcile' operation that implements revision semantics. In addition, we would like to know how the reviewer might anticipate implementing the automated reconciliation. </blockquote>
