# FHIR Clinical Documents
This implementation guide defines a canonical representation of a clinical document in FHIR. It serves as a common universal starting point for those creating their own FHIR clinical document specifications, and supports users of the HL7 Clinical Document Architecture who wish to migrate to a FHIR-based representation of clinical documents.

The FHIR Clinical Documents IG derives from <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/documents.html">core FHIR Documents guidance</a>, adding further guidance and constraints.
