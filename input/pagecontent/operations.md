### FHIR Clinical Document Operations
[FHIR Operations](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/operations.html) are a supplement to standard queries, and are used to fulfill a number of purposes, such as where the server needs to play an active role in formulating the content of the response, where the intended purpose is to cause side effects such as the creation of new resources, or where there are server-side expectations in response to a client request.
