# intended use of unity UCUM value with annotation for tablet
UCUM Codes that contain human readable annotations like {tablet} can be misleading (e.g. they are ignored when comparing units). Best Practice is not to depend on annotations in the UCUM code, so this usage should be checked

# These slices are additional demonstration slices and not meant to match the declared slice

# A required slice is using LOINC code 107903-7 | Clinical note. This code will be published in August. LOINC is added as a complete version to the HL7 Terminology server. Unlike code systems that are loaded as fragments into the HL7 Terminology server, there is no process to manually add pre-release LOINC codes. The error will be rectified after August when a new version of LOINC is added.
